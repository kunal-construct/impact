Among the many future innovations 5G will enable, smart cities will be one of the most revolutionary, as this article I came across on @Forbes by @Deloitte’s @Craig Wigginton and @Brian Greenberg makes a clear illustration of. Smart cities are being built all over the world, and we don't have to look far, as we're already seeing this example in the development of Tengah into Singapore’s first smart and sustainable town.5G's smart city applications don't end with connectivity: the technology also has the potential to boost public safety, improve environmental governance, promote inclusive healthcare, and enable smart governance to improve the quality of life for citizens.While there's no doubt that 5G technology is integral to bringing the smart city vision into reality, there is still work to be done in clearing the path from potential roadblocks. On the technology front, next-level interconnectivity can give rise to security challenges, which is why security needs to be embedded at the heart of design and implementation. This can be addressed when ecosystem partners—governments, enterprises, software providers, device manufacturers, energy providers, and network service providers—form better synergies and do their parts. There should be a clearer business model in terms of sharing development, governance, and benefits if we're to orchestrate secure, widespread deployment with ease and break information silos along the way.Despite the challenges, I'm positive that we're making good progress. What are your thoughts?#smartcities #smartcity #5G #connectivity

The recent periods of global economic disruptions have driven home a hard lesson for many tech companies when it comes to their people strategy. In an industry where change is the name of the game, agility and adaptability in times of uncertainty require finding the right talent, putting them in settings where they can be successful, and supporting their continued development over time. And this commitment to our tech talents should not only be within the confines of the company—it is equally important that we view them as individuals with personal lives that need nurturing.With the job market flooding with talents due to recent big tech layoffs, I think a genuine and stronger focus on talent attraction and management will be crucial to making the right hires and ensuring they contribute to driving innovation.At Singtel, we believe investing in our people is critical to our success, which is why we're prioritising their professional growth and personal well-being and building an inclusive culture that inspires innovation and progress. We're committed to helping our people succeed in their careers and personal lives, and we're constantly creating opportunities to make space for these aspects to coexist. I couldn’t be more proud of seeing these successes unfold firsthand.#futureofwork #talentenablement #talentmanagement #employeeexperience #peoplestrategy

Transforming the NUS Giving brand website: From Dated to Timeless

Replaced boxy layouts with flowing, organic shapes
Introduced an impactful "See the Possibility" campaign
Created an intuitive, visually-driven navigation
Incorporated storytelling to showcase real impact
Balanced white space with rich media for enhanced engagement
Modernised the colour palette whilst maintaining brand recognition
The result: A transformative design that elevates NUS Giving from a static repository to an inspiring, interactive platform.

RECLAIMING COMMUNITY. REDEFINING VOICE. SCALING BOLDNESS.
Powered by AI

BLOCK71, once a vibrant startup hub, risked being seen as just another co-working space. With a lean team spread across global hubs, its corporate tone failed to resonate with founders. To reclaim relevance, the brand needed to deploy a bold new voice — “Home of the Brave” — quickly and consistently across all channels.
CHALLENGE
OBJECTIVE
Deploy a new brand voice — “Home of the Brave” — across multiple channels quickly, with minimal manpower
BLOCK71
AI | Brand

We analysed founder needs and competitor ecosystems, revealing the gap between being seen as a “workspace” versus a true ally. This insight guided the creation of a Verbal Identity Guide that translated “Home of the Brave” into clear, practical messaging principles.
The outcome: a unifying brand blueprint that positioned BLOCK71 as a global founder community and laid the foundation for scalable, AI-powered content creation.

ABM REIMAGINED FOR COMPLEXITY AND SCALE

Conventional ABM was more hype than reality for Zebra. With 80 accounts, 3,000+ contacts, and a wide mix of roles, seniorities, and pain points, complexity made one-to-one execution impossible.

Sales team lacked capacity to craft personalised content.
No clear line between marketing and sales ownership.

CELEBRATING 20 YEARS OF SUCCESS WHILE ENVISIONING A BRIGHT FUTURE

Duke-NUS 20th Anniversary



Thinking 20 years beyond the 20th Anniversary
Client Challenge

As Duke-NUS commemorates its 20th anniversary, the School required a distinctive campaign identity and narrative encapsulating its pioneering journey and achievements, while articulating a visionary outlook for the next 20 years and beyond.

Duke-NUS Medical School

Our Approach

We developed a vibrant anniversary logo as the key visual element uniting all campaign assets. The interlocking graphic design symbolised the enduring partnership between NUS and Duke University. This focus on partnership also formed the basis of the anniversary narrative featured on the anniversary microsite and supporting films now in development.

Client Challenge

Low Organic Reach & Engagement
In Asia-Pacific & Japan, SAP relied heavily on paid media to drive reach and engagement among their audience. Organic search and social content discovery is an untapped area of opportunity for the taking. But how do we find the right audience and what do we say to them?

Disparate, Siloed Systems
SAP Product teams and Marketing teams operate independently from one another. Their communications often target the same audiences, resulting in cannibalization of leads between departments. Information flow between Marketing and Sales teams is fragmented

ITMA 2023 Website Development

With live events on hold, ITMA needed to continue to engage its members online and generate interest in their involvement in the textile industry in a post-COVID world. 

Unfortunately, their website was dated, poorly planned and not optimised for mobile, giving users a negative experience that did not reflect the organisation’s values.

It was also  difficult to find relevant information required as an Exhibitor, Visitor & Media.

GAME-CHANGING GROWTH WITH AN 86% RISE IN APPLICATIONS

NUS SCALE CET Lifelong Learning Campaign
Vivid, eye-catching creative branding for NUS SCALE’s “Level Up to 100” initiative 



NUS SCALE
Brand awareness | Education
Promoting lifelong learning in the era of longevity
CHALLENGE

NUS SCALE had always marketed its CET course in a tactical, ad hoc manner. As a consequence, the school was falling behind the undisputed CET category leader - SkillsFuture. 

Our job was to help NUS SCALE establish a distinct brand to compete in the crowded CET market while continuing to drive sign-ups for its huge catalogue of courses.
B2HUMAN INSIGHT

It’s game-over for the linear life of ‘Learn/Earn/Retire’.  

Singapore’s labour force participation rate of older age groups is rising. Given the rate of digital disruption and technological innovation, staying relevant and living well means prioritising learning. 

Taking this as our guiding principle, we developed a brand strategy to promote a habit of continuous learning in the era of longevity.

A winning game plan

Our solution was to show that CET is vital to realise our full potential as we LEVEL UP TO 100. 

The campaign creative leans into the design language of gaming to stand out from cliched category conventions of smiling lifelong learners. 

From video ads and banners to landing pages and content marketing, we took inspiration from the most iconic games to drive home our 
LEVEL UP TO 100 message.

Smashing the high score

The decision to move away from running tactical course-specific ads to focus efforts on building awareness of lifelong learning has really delivered 
for NUS SCALE.

This brand-led approach is reinforcing 
NUS SCALE’s reputation as the leading 
lifelong learning partner shaping the
global workforce.

Implement engagement metrics to track and optimise performance
Execute a plan to shift perceptions of Anna from broadcaster to relatable leader

NUS Business School
Digital Marketing & Consulting | Creative | Media
B2HUMAN INSIGHT

A business person undertakes an MBA for a truly life-changing experience.

To differentiate the NUS MBA, we needed to bring to the fore the incredible range of personal and professional experiences that NUS offers.

The NUS MBA programme is arguably, the world’s most varied in terms of options and allows you to build a truly transformative MBA experience.



Hyper-personalised 
journeys in action

We designed a persona-driven, multi-channel strategy that targeted seven unique personas with hyper-personalised content and hundreds of optimised creative assets that matched them with the right MBA programme, at every stage of their journey. 


NUS Business School
Digital Marketing & Consulting | Creative | Media 

Salesforce Integration

The campaign was heavily supported with technical support and integrations for different tools.
On the Salesforce side, we connected the Landing Page forms and the Lead Gen Ads directly with the CRM.

On the landing page, we implemented the forms that we generated in Salesforce. Hence, every time a user fills out the form, the CRM will be updated in real-time.

On the Lead Gen Ads, we use the connectors between Facebook and LinkedIn with Salesforce. Every time a user fills out the Lead Gen Ad Form, the lead will automatically arrive to Salesforce.

CHALLENGE

The RUCKUS® Cloud team commissioned us to create an integrated persona-based digital campaign that mirrored the concepts B2C brands use to deliver meaning and value.

As a result, our solution had to be informative, educational and address specific varied persona pain points. 

Our prospects had to believe and trust RUCKUS® Cloud and its solution offering before making any action or purchase.

RUCKUS® Cloud’s Eye View, a parallax microsite, designed with a high degree of interactivity. 

Strategic content is at the heart of the campaign to capture, inform, captivate and persuade business users to choose RUCKUS® Cloud as the ideal AI-enabled network management-as-a-service platform.

Concept | SEO Strategy | Content Development | Publishing

THE CHALLENGE

It is extremely tough to rank a brand-new website on Google Search in a short period of time. While we an SEO strategy in place, we knew that at best we were at least three months away from appearing on Google’s SERP-1. But the Multiplier team needed a win much quicker than that.

The keyword they selected - “peo platform” - was also a competitive one, so that didn’t exactly make things any easier.
THE STRATEGY

What if we could ride on the shoulders of giants? 
We knew the secret power that news sites held. Beyond just being publishers with a captive audience, they also had websites with great SEO value.
We zeroed in on publications that would not only effectively reach Multiplier’s target audience of Startup founders and hiring managers, but also be able to boost their presence on Google SERP-1. 
After a week of outreach and negotiations, we found the perfect fit: entrepreneur.com

Multiplier

SOLUTION

We developed the right piece of content for submission to Entrepreneur.com’s team – balancing the three key criteria:
Ensuring content and titles were optimised to rank for the keyword “peo platform”
Ensuring the content would send readers back to Multiplier’s website to turn into leads
Ensuring we adhered to Entrepreneur.com’s strict editorial guidelines

OBJECTIVE

Acquire and nurture leads for the NUS EE Digital Transformation Course.


THE INSIGHT

FESTIVE CONTENT DOMINATE SERP-1 FOR 85 OUT OF 100 KEYWORDS
Giant Hypermart

Case Study
Giant Singapore,
Explosive Organic Traffic
Objective
Acquire traffic for everyday household items sold in Giant Hypermart. What they wanted was a sound marketing strategy that would drive organic inbound traffic to their existing website and at the same time engage with their thousands of customers.
The Insight
eCommerce traffic is a costly affair. We needed to find a way for Giant to appear on SERP-1 using organic tactics. After carefully identifying the personas and their needs, we created content pillars associated with two major festivities: Christmas and Chinese New Year. We’d seen an opportunity to take advantage of consumers’ active shopping behaviour during the holiday seasons.

The Solution
With content pillars like Christmas Food, Christmas Decorations DIY and Chinese New Year Food Ideas, we crafted Power Pages (rich blog posts) that not only featured primary and secondary festive keywords Giant wanted to rank for, but were also ultimately helpful for the readers. 

85 of 100 selected keywords on SERP-1

IMDA - AI Verify Foundation 
IMDA Singapore was fast to market with the AI Verify Foundation, yet another significant milestone. To support the launch, they needed a website to be written, designed, developed and deployed in 2 months. The foundation's website needed a modern, visually appealing design with a user-friendly interface that would work perfectly everywhere. 
THE CHALLENGE
Sometimes the insight is not about the end users but really understanding what the client is trying to achieve. 
In this case, the 2-month fixed deadline was the guiding principle. Once we truly understood this, we were able to effectively guide the client to success within the stipulated time frame.

CRAFTING STORIES TO SHOW DATA ANALYTICS IS FOR EVERYONE 
SAP Demand Generation

THE CHALLENGE

Despite being in the self-serve analytics market since 2015, SAP Analytics Cloud (SAC) did not take off and was eclipsed by its competitors. Limited by a lack of awareness and ineffective marketing tactics, SAC found it difficult to deliver on its core value proposition: data analytics is for everyone.

B2HUMAN INSIGHT

Our research revealed the average business user fears data, believing specialised skills are essential to make sense of it. In order to sell this complex product, we needed to find a way to demonstrate its power without intimidating our audience.

ESET



ESET
SEO | Website | Content
THE CHALLENGE

ESET struggled to gain exposure for their XDR and MDR products in the B2B market, despite their B2C popularity. 

Their existing content failed to rank well for organic search, and they lacked informational content to target top-of-funnel audiences for their competitive and technical product terms.

OUR APPROACH

We conducted in-depth keyword research to identify common search variations, analyse SERPs, and determine the top-ranking content. 

Based on our findings, we proposed creating technical articles targeting niche audiences, linking to specific product pages to improve page authority and drive search traffic for product and top-of-funnel keywords.

Our team optimised three product pages and created eight technical articles to improve ESET's rankings for brand keywords and previously unranked keywords. We focused on delivering high-quality, informative content that would resonate with the target audience and drive organic engagement.

Marketing Transformation
An evidence-based podcast to champion what it takes to create effective marketing.
The challenge that the National Gallery put forward to us was to increase visitorship from both tourists and locals.
We devised an entire marketing transformation plan to identify, engage and convert potential visitors across their key markets using a multi-touch, omni-channel approach.

A evidence-based transformative approach to encouraging the marketing industry to change how they work for the better.

Client Challenge

In a word: Ineffectiveness

The marketing industry across Asia Pacific was having a crisis of confidence in the effectiveness of marketing investment and the need for creativity.

As the industry’s lead publisher, Campaign Asia Pacific, needed to drive both the agenda for and the evidence of, how ground-breaking creative partnerships between marketers and their agencies, was delivering category-beating marketing performance.

Our B2Human Insight

5-years research across Asia Pacific’s highest-performing Agency/Marketer Partnerships showed it was the relationships of trust between people that drove outstanding work and results.

We needed to find a mechanism that enabled us to get the protagonists talking about how they worked together as partners, and what this delivered in terms of marketing creativity and business performance.
Campaign Asia Pacific
Concept | Creative/Experience | Host/Produce | Publishing

Creative solution

A bi-monthly podcast was designed and developed called Creation Stories.

As host, Richard would choose amazing campaigns from all across Asia Pacific and then interview together, the lead marketer and lead agency person, on the back-story to how the campaign was created, produced and run.

As part of the interview many key insights would be uncovered into how to work together in partnership.

Branding | Creative | Social Media 
Redesigning the look & feel of student hostels for better SocMed engagement and experience

Client Challenge

When it comes to hostel options, first year students are spoiled for choice. 

Three hostels - Lighthouse, Prince George’s Park, and UTown Residences - needed to differentiate themselves from the pack, but how?



B2Human Insight

Students care about what a hostel stands for and will align themselves with a house if it’s values reflect theirs.

We proposed unique design languages and messaging for each hostel to convey their values to students, then ran this across Instagram and TikTok for SocMed engagement. 
NUS Office of Student Affairs
Branding | Creative | Social Media 

For Prince George Park Residences, we use symbolic graphic elements to visually represent “multiculturalism” and “diversity” that are key to the identity of the hostel.

Echoing LightHouse's ethos of
"Finding Your Light", our design elements takes inspiration from light beams and specks of light to bring forward the idea that LightHouse is a space where residents can shine, discover themselves, and follow their passions.
UTown Residences is one-of-kind in its architecture and the comforts it provides—one that evokes modernity and upscale living. As such, we make use of sleek geometric lines and shapes to build a design system that mimics the sophistication of UTR's structure.

Placemaking Course Registration
Answering the What? and Where? of Placemaking
Objective
Bring awareness and applications to SCALE’s Placemaking individual course modules and the Professional Certificate Programme. Let Singapore know that Placemaking is a certifiable profession. 
The Insight
Placemaking is niche and not well understood in Singapore. Often other events/pop-ups are confused with Placemaking.
The common thread between all potential Placemaking students isn’t career progression but imagination.
The Solution
Answer “What is Placemaking?” with creatives that engage users to ask “What is possible in a given space?”  

Use key line illustrations superimposed on real world shots to convey a sense of imagination and purpose to places everyone in Singapore can recognise. Scale this out across creatives and online touchpoints to drive course applications.

B2Human Insight

A business person undertakes an MBA for a truly life-changing experience.

To differentiate the NUS MBA, we needed to bring to the fore the incredible range of personal and professional experiences that NUS offers.

The NUS MBA programme is arguably, the world’s most varied in terms of options and allows you to build a truly transformative MBA experience.

Marketing Transformation
In Action

We designed a persona-driven, multi-channel strategy that targeted seven unique personas with hyper-personalised content and hundreds of optimised creative assets that matched them with the right MBA programme, at every stage of their journey.

Salesforce Integration

The campaign was heavily supported with technical support and integrations for different tools.
On the Salesforce side, we connected the Landing Page forms and the Lead Gen Ads directly with the CRM.

On the landing page, we implemented the forms that we generated in Salesforce. Hence, every time a user fills out the form, the CRM will be updated in real-time.

On the Lead Gen Ads, we use the connectors between Facebook and LinkedIn with Salesforce. Every time a user fills out the Lead Gen Ad Form, the lead will automatically arrive to Salesforce.

Giant Singapore,
Explosive Organic Traffic
Objective
Acquire traffic for everyday household items sold in Giant Hypermart. What they wanted was a sound marketing strategy that would drive organic inbound traffic to their existing website and at the same time engage with their thousands of customers.
The Insight
eCommerce traffic is a costly affair. We needed to find a way for Giant to appear on SERP-1 using organic tactics. After carefully identifying the personas and their needs, we created content pillars associated with two major festivities: Christmas and Chinese New Year. We’d seen an opportunity to take advantage of consumers’ active shopping behaviour during the holiday seasons.

The Solution
With content pillars like Christmas Food, Christmas Decorations DIY and Chinese New Year Food Ideas, we crafted Power Pages (rich blog posts) that not only featured primary and secondary festive keywords Giant wanted to rank for, but were also ultimately helpful for the readers. 

85 of 100 selected keywords on SERP-1

Client Challenge

Despite a longstanding commitment to CSR through its SGX Bull Charge fundraising activities, the SGX CSR story was largely untold and unknown.

Great things happen when people come together.

SGX views CSR differently. Beyond just giving, the organisation believes in participation and the collective potential that comes with it.

Taking inspiration from the role that SGX plays in building ecosystems to facilitate the exchange of capital and ideas, we adopted a platform approach to creating positive impact by rallying investors, companies, partners and colleagues to make “BETTER HAPPENS TOGETHER”.

SGX Cares was brought to life as a sub-brand with a
clear and compelling Mission, Identity
and Narrative.

We made a vast library of religious materials available as interactive modules on an educational portal. Mobile and kiosk applications were also developed to enable people to follow their own spiritual journey at community centres.

Thanks to the education portal and supporting applications, practitioners were able to continue with their religious practice without interruption during the pandemic.

Promoting lifelong learning in the era of longevity

Client Challenge


NUS SCALE had always marketed its CET course in a tactical, ad hoc manner. As a consequence, the school was falling behind the undisputed CET category leader - SkillsFuture. 

Our job was to help NUS SCALE establish a distinct brand to compete in the crowded CET market while continuing to drive sign-ups for its huge catalogue of courses.

B2Human Insight

It’s game-over for the linear life of ‘Learn/Earn/Retire’.  

Singapore’s labour force participation rate of older age groups is rising. Given the rate of digital disruption and technological innovation, staying relevant and living well means prioritising learning. 

Taking this as our guiding principle, we developed a brand strategy that sought to inculcate a habit of continuous learning in the era of longevity.
The need to embrace a multistage life in the era of longevity was the core insight driving our brand strategy.

Our solution was to show that CET is vital to realise our full potential as we LEVEL UP TO 100. 

The campaign creative leans into the design language of gaming to stand out from cliched category conventions of smiling lifelong learners. 

From video ads and banners to landing pages and content marketing, we took inspiration from the most iconic games to drive home our LEVEL UP TO 100 message.

CEO Thought-leadership Programme
Leadership Conversations

Recap
The following slides provide an overview of the “Leadership Conversations” programme Construct previously designed and managed for SAP’s new SE Asia CEO, Rachel Barger.

The focus of this 6-month programme for Rachel, was to build meaningful relationships and connections on Linkedin with real, identified prospect CXOs.

As there may be similarities between what was conducted for SAP, and what potentially may enhance Anna’s new Business Development responsibilities, the next session between Construct and Singtel will aim to explore the: 
Critical Success Factors from the SAP programme
Focus/Nuances of Anna’s new responsibilities
Any business development strategies already in play to be factored

And with these details, we can tailor a framework that would suit Anna’s requirements.

Client Challenge

SAP was finding it increasingly difficult and expensive to acquire net new CXO names.

Having worked with SAP on paid media campaigns for many years, we knew that tweaking the formula wouldn’t deliver the results our clients were after.

So we decided to come up with a totally new way to engage new C-Suites.


For over a decade, SAP has used standard demand generation methods to acquire prospects and nurture them into leads.
In recent times, SAP’s teams especially in SEA have struggled to get past Mid-level managers through to decision makers.
This led us to develop a unique outreach strategy targeting primarily CXOs and senior level executives within SAP’s target group

B2Human Insight

Personal Connections Lead To Better Business

To establish a more meaningful connection with our C-Suite, we decided to run a direct ABM campaign leveraging the social influence of SAP Managing Director (SEA) Rachel Barger. 

There were multiple challenges with this social selling approach. C-suite audiences might not even be on social. Tracking the growth of profile awareness and influence is also hard to measure. Plus, there was a dearth of data concerning what type of content succeeds or fails with CXOs. We had to find it all out ourselves.

Our B2Human insight showed that personal connections would be the key to getting access and engaging with decision makers in a way that conventional marketing cannot.
We built an Account Based Marketing programme that leveraged the social influence of SAP’s Managing Director (SEA) Rachel Barger

Our social influence framework is grounded in data mining and analysis. We used insights extracted by our data science team to define Rachel’s ‘Social’ voice - establishing her as a thought leader for key topics.
Then began an intensive six month content propagation, and engagement programme targeting content topics that other relevant CXOs were interested in

 Results
Out of 215 targeted CXOs we pinpointed on LinkedIn, Rachel is now connected to:

This led to Rachel engaging with over 200 CXOs during the programme lifecycle and eventually connecting with 69 of them. Many of those connections have since graduated to becoming active opportunities for the SAP team in the region.

In fact, we are about to kick off a similar social influence programme with the CEO of Singtel in the next few weeks.

Demand Generation & Lead Capture Program

For SAP, we devised a digital ecosystem centered around an integrated content hub and radically transformed the way SAP discovers, captures, nurtures and qualifies potential leads into customers across Southeast Asia.

Client Challenge

Low Organic Reach & Engagement
In Asia-Pacific & Japan, SAP relied heavily on paid media to drive reach and engagement among their audience. Organic search and social content discovery is an untapped area of opportunity for the taking. But how do we find the right audience and what do we say to them?

Disparate, Siloed Systems
SAP Product teams and Marketing teams operate independently from one another. Their communications often target the same audiences, resulting in cannibalization of leads between departments. Information flow between Marketing and Sales teams is fragmented

Overview
The challenge

The solution
Define gaps and challenges across different audience groups and translate this into a relevant go-to-market strategy 

Launch a full funnel campaign, commencing with  creating awareness and engagement for SSS, leading up to converting prospects into SRI tool users. 

Client’s original brief was to launch an awareness campaign and  generate leads for its SRI tool, to effectively apply for certification.

However, market situation in ZA and IN indicates there is a pressing need to address more fundamental issues such as general awareness and government response towards their overall offering, ie sanitation and sustainability services (SSS). This is critical before decision-makers can buy into the SRI.

Furthermore, different target audience groups have varying needs between each market. The challenge also is how can we create an umbrella strategy that works across all.

Marketing Transformation
An experiential customer journey programme for the tourism and arts sector.
The challenge that the National Gallery put forward to us was to increase visitorship from both tourists and locals.
We devised an entire marketing transformation plan to identify, engage and convert potential visitors across their key markets using a multi-touch, omni-channel approach.

National Gallery Singapore
Customer Journey | Creative | Media 
A transformative integrated customer journey and channel/ creative strategy for a complex segmentation problem

Client Challenge

In a word: Complexity.

The National Gallery Singapore had invested in a complex customer segmentation model which they needed to find a way to activate.

Pressure was multiplied with the launch of a world-first Matisse/Picasso exhibition which absolutely had to be seen to be successful.

B2Human Insight

Micro-segments have many diverse stated reasons for visiting an exhibition/gallery, but what is common is the desire for an experience.

To attract a volume of visitors from both tourists and locals, we had to define the real customer journey and then create experiential strategies using both digital and physical touchpoints, to pull potential visitors to and through the Matisse/ Picasso exhibition.
National Gallery Singapore
Customer Journey | Creative | Media 

User journey design
I’m not gonna delve into too much detail on this one but really just wanted to show you a snapshot of the journey we built for them across roughly 50 touchpoints right from the discovery stage to planning their trip, arriving at the National Gallery and moving about inside to after they leave.

We split these journeys across the two target profiles - Tourists and Locals to really drive home the message in a contextually relevant, compelling manner. 

Customer channel & creative strategy
Next we built an omni-channel approach that went far beyond the conventional - using a combination of both digital + traditional + experiential in a unique way making this an end to end conversion funnel.

Now obviously there was a lot of work that went into crafting this strategy - including research, data analysis looking at the gallery’s digital platforms/internal data, etc. We also built a strong creative platform leveraging their key exhibition that year which was for Picasso & Matisse.

To continue raising awareness about pre-payment protection and online shopping scams in Singapore, CASE wanted a fun and interesting way to educate the public. 
Client
Problem
Social platforms are now littered with countless advertisements. To stand out, we looked at different studies done and found that audiences react better to personalised messages. 

Consumer Insight
Using a familiar neighbourhood auntie with tailored messages – We created Auntie Savvy, a knowledgeable and powerful symbol in Singapore culture. To help Auntie Savvy reach out to more people, we created tailored messages that appear based on search intent and popular topics.

Solution

As part of the 2020-21 Consumer Education Campaign, we created ‘Auntie Steady’ – a Campaign Ambassador for CASE
Auntie Steady* is not your regular Singaporean Auntie.
She’s a sassy straight talker with zero patience for anything dishonest or unfair.
Auntie Steady serves up handy tips about big prepayment decisions. She also encourages people to visit the CASE website to learn more. 

As the campaign ambassador, her role was to communicate key messages in a memorable and relatable way.

Extraordinary customer service. It’s hard to describe, but you know the real thing when you see it. 

In this direction, we introduce two characters to front the campaign. Our first protagonist is a ‘real’ CX expert who absolutely gets it while his friend tries but really doesn’t. The result is funny and memorable exchanges that are just, well, ‘unreal’.

Retargeting Ad
The creative concept can be adapted as hardworking static ads to drive users to the landing page.


Channels:
Facebook, LinkedIn

Landing Page
The creative concept is carried through in the landing page where users are nudged to submit their details to access a demo video.

Demo Video
To provide a seamless customer journey, we could consider extending the campaign concept with a localised demo video. This would also allow us to reframe the demo around the key business benefits:
Increased self-service adoption

Get Multiplier Ranked on Google as quickly as possible

Objective

As a new entrant to the market seeking to raise a fresh round of VC funding, Multiplier needed to quickly establish some social proof (or ‘search proof’).
Focus

Develop a proprietary SEO method to quickly gain Search Ranking

Get on page 1 of Google Search for competitive keywords like “Professional Employer Organisation” & “peo platform”


Multiplier
Concept | SEO Strategy | Content Development | Publishing

The Challenge
It is extremely tough to rank a brand-new website on Google Search in a short period of time. While we an SEO strategy in place, we knew that at best we were at least three months away from appearing on Google’s SERP-1. But the Multiplier team needed a win much quicker than that.
The keyword they selected - “peo platform” - was also a competitive one, so that didn’t exactly make things any easier.
The Strategy
What if we could ride on the shoulders of giants? 
We knew the secret power that news sites held. Beyond just being publishers with a captive audience, they also had websites with great SEO value.
We zeroed in on publications that would not only effectively reach Multiplier’s target audience of Startup founders and hiring managers, but also be able to boost their presence on Google SERP-1. 
After a week of outreach and negotiations, we found the perfect fit: entrepreneur.com

Multiplier

Solution

We developed the right piece of content for submission to Entrepreneur.com’s team – balancing the three key criteria:
Ensuring content and titles were optimised to rank for the keyword “peo platform”
Ensuring the content would send readers back to Multiplier’s website to turn into leads
Ensuring we adhered to Entrepreneur.com’s strict editorial guidelines

ITMA
Challenge, Insight and Action
THE CHALLENGE
With live events on hold for the foreseeable future, ITMA needed to continue to engage its members and generate interest in their involvement in the textile industry in a post-COVID world.

NUS MBA
Challenge, Insight and Action
THE CHALLENGE
With an increasing number of MBA degrees from all over the world, it was difficult for NUS to differentiate against global Universities such as Harvard, CEIBS and Insead. Also, previous attempts to differentiate NUS Business School and position its MBA programmes (MBA, EMBA, NUS-UCLA EMBA) to the right audiences had not delivered the expected results.

THE INSIGHT
Based on the market research, past campaign data and an analysis of different personas, we found that MBA campaigns did not work due to poor UI/UX of the landing page that resulted in a low conversion rate
THE SOLUTION
Identified target audience for all three programmes
Redesigned the MBA Programme landing page to make it more user-friendly and optimized for Lead Conversion.

Intelligent Automation
Making Marketing Automation work for you

This next story is for Inchcape - the sole distributor for Toyota and Lexus cars in Singapore. The traditional method that is used in the automobile industry is they run classic road shows in the mall, people drop name cards – and we have a heap of ‘cold leads’ sitting there.

The problem really is: How do you sell a car to them? 
So the goal here was to find a way to bucket these contacts into segments and turn these cold leads into hot using marketing automation (drive them into the showroom)

How:
Understand your buyers

Develop content to push them further down the funnel

Intelligent Marketing Automation
What was done:
We put our personas at the centre of our universe and asked what they would want from a car dealer. 
We then crafted out 4 different workflows that were designed to push users to a desired action in an approach we call “helping is selling.”
Email 1 – Broad intro email with multiple cars to establish which ‘category/persona’ you fit within and profile the user
Follow up emails - Further refine our understanding of the user profile based on their preferences (determined through the actions they take within the email)

Xero TCOB 3.0
Empowering Singapore SMBs
How Xero’s TCOB 3.0 Campaign Drove Strong Brand Recall Across 35 Million Impressions
The next example is a proprietary framework that we have internally developed for SAP’s C-suite.

Xero TCOB 3.0
Digital & Traditional Media | Creative
Situation
Before this campaign, Xero had built initial awareness among Singapore’s Small and Medium-sized Businesses (SMBs) but needed to deepen brand recall and reinforce its position as the go-to solution for easing administrative and accounting pain points. Many SMBs were still unaware of how streamlined tools could free up time to grow their businesses.
For over a decade, SAP has used standard demand generation methods to acquire prospects and nurture them into leads.
In recent times, SAP’s teams especially in SEA have struggled to get past Mid-level managers through to decision makers.
This led us to develop a unique outreach strategy targeting primarily CXOs and senior level executives within SAP’s target group

Xero TCOB 3.0
Digital & Traditional Media | Creative
Insight
Building on learnings from TCOB 2.0, the team recognised that a consistent, multi-channel presence was key to capturing attention during the daily routines of busy business owners. We identified high-frequency offline and online touchpoints — from transit hubs and office lifts to news sites, radio, and even food courts — to keep Xero top of mind whenever and wherever SMB owners went about their day.

Xero TCOB 3.0
Digital & Traditional Media | Creative
Challenge
To shift awareness to deeper brand recall, the team needed to balance online and offline channels to reach different sub-groups within the SMB community: sole traders, small business owners, and aspiring employers. The challenge was maximising impact with a limited media budget in a highly competitive market cluttered with competing solutions and noise.

Xero TCOB 3.0

Victory
Over three months, Xero’s TCOB 3.0 campaign achieved strong results:
Over 35 million impressions delivered island-wide.
A comprehensive media mix covering digital, OOH, TV, radio, podcast, and influencer content.
Presence across 947 digital screens, strategic transit placements, and prime-time TV and radio spots — maximising daily touchpoints for higher brand recall.
This omnichannel approach built on local insights has positioned Xero as an essential partner for SMBs ready to “Take Care of Your Business” — with brand awareness stronger than ever.

How Toll’s TOTB Campaign Captured 3.8 Million Impressions and 10K Clicks Across 13 Markets

The next example is a proprietary framework that we have internally developed for SAP’s C-suite.

Toll - TOTB 
Digital Media | Creative
Situation
Before this campaign, Toll’s global brand awareness was fragmented across key markets — from Singapore and Australia to the US and EMEA. There was untapped potential to solidify Toll’s position as the trusted partner for Global Forwarding and Logistics solutions, especially among decision-makers in logistics, supply chain, procurement, and distribution roles.

In recent times, SAP’s teams especially in SEA have struggled to get past Mid-level managers through to decision makers.
This led us to develop a unique outreach strategy targeting primarily CXOs and senior level executives within SAP’s target group

Insight
Rather than rely on a single market approach, we developed a finely tuned multi-market, multi-channel strategy. By grouping countries based on CPC efficiency, user behaviour, and platform popularity, we maximised the budget’s reach — using LinkedIn prospecting and retargeting tactics alongside Google Search, Display, YouTube, and Meta placements. This full-funnel strategy combined brand awareness with tactical lead generation.

Challenge
Toll needed to reach highly specific B2B decision-makers in diverse regions, each with unique media consumption habits.

For over a decade, SAP has used standard demand generation methods to acquire prospects and nurture them into leads.
In recent times, SAP’s teams especially in SEA have struggled to get past Mid-level managers through to decision makers.

THE CHALLENGE

NUS faced significant technical and behavioural obstacles that hindered online donations. A poor "Give Now" experience, low visibility of calls-to-action, and a lengthy user journey led to a high bounce rate of 65% and limited engagement. 

Additionally, prospective donors lacked awareness of NUS Giving and the motivation to contribute, further compounding the challenges.
OUR RESEARCH

Our research revealed that prospective donors required a clear, compelling, and seamless journey to fully understand the impact of NUS Giving and feel genuinely motivated to contribute. 

By addressing the technical issues and crafting a narrative that resonated with their desires to make a difference, we could unlock their potential to support the cause.

Crafting a path to action

We strategically re-designed the website to offer a personalised user journey based on stakeholder preferences, encapsulating thought-provoking stories and placing crucial information on the homepage.

The streamlined information architecture reduced the time taken to complete tasks, while four critical design components – informative menus, real people features, clear CTAs, and a clean design – enhanced clarity, navigation, and engagement.
