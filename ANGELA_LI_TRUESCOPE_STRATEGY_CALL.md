## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - ANGELA/TRUESCOPE PROFILE

### **Company Context:**
- **Product:** AI-powered real-time media monitoring and intelligence platform for PR/comms teams
- **Size:** 51-200 employees (growth-stage SaaS)
- **HQ:** Sydney, with operations across Asia, New Zealand, US
- **Funding:** US$6.2M seed round (Investible, Jelix Ventures) earmarked for US expansion
- **Customers:** 250+ corporate and government clients across APAC
- **Markets:** Asia-Pacific (including Singapore), Australia/NZ, North America (recent expansion)
- **Buyer Personas:** Heads of Communications, PR Directors, Corporate Affairs, Marketing Leads, Government comms teams

### **Angela's Profile:**
- **Seniority:** Senior/Lead-level (hands-on owner, not junior executor)
- **Experience:** 8-10+ years across in-house/agency, data-driven campaigns, content, events, APAC
- **Likely Accountable For:** Pipeline contribution, campaign strategy, content, events, sales/CS enablement
- **Budget Authority:** Probable influencer, needs buy-in from founders/regional leadership for $40K+ decisions
- **Sophistication Level:** HIGH - Will care about proof (CPL, pipeline, attribution), not superficial "more leads" promises

### **Strategic Hypothesis:**
Angela is managing multi-market demand generation (likely APAC + potentially US support) with complex buyer committees (comms, procurement, IT, leadership, legal for government/enterprise deals). She's probably feeling the squeeze of:
1. **Multi-market orchestration chaos** (Asia, ANZ, US with different buyer dynamics)
2. **Proving marketing ROI to investors/founders** post-funding (pressure to show pipeline $$$)
3. **Generic messaging challenge** (How do you speak to a Government PR lead vs. Enterprise Comms Director vs. Agency owner?)

**Tier Fit:** Likely **Regional** (3-6 markets) or **light-Enterprise** (6+ markets) given company footprint, BUT may need **Pilot as proof point** in highest-priority market before scaling.

---

## PRE-CALL RESEARCH SUMMARY

### ✅ **What We Know:**

**Company Expansion Context:**
- Recent US$6.2M seed funding specifically for US expansion
- Growing from Asia/ANZ base into North America
- Positioning as "next-generation" / AI-powered vs. legacy media monitoring providers
- 250+ clients = significant scale, but growth-stage (not mature)

**Angela's Likely Challenges:**
1. **Multi-market orchestration** - Supporting pipeline across Asia, ANZ, and now US with different buying dynamics
2. **Founder/investor pressure** - Post-funding, needs to prove marketing drives revenue (not just press mentions or MQLs)
3. **Complex buying committees** - Government clients = long cycles, multiple approvals (procurement, legal, leadership)
4. **Differentiation** - Competing against legacy providers and newer AI-powered competitors

**Sophistication Signals:**
- 8-10+ years experience = will expect data-driven conversation
- Works in SaaS = understands funnel metrics, attribution, CPL
- Data-driven campaigns focus = won't be impressed by "we'll get you more leads"
- Events and content experience = knows the long nurture cycle for B2B

### ❓ **What We Need to Discover:**

1. **Scope Clarity:** Which markets is SHE personally responsible for? (APAC only? APAC + US support? All regions?)
2. **Budget Authority:** Who else is involved in $40K+ marketing decisions? (Founders? Regional MD? CMO?)
3. **Urgency Driver:** What's the timeline pressure? US expansion launch? Investor reporting? Pipeline targets?
4. **Primary Pain:** Is it multi-market chaos? Proving ROI? Generic messaging? All three?
5. **Buying Committee Reality:** How many stakeholders involved in Truescope deals? (Comms, procurement, IT, legal, leadership?)

## CALL STRUCTURE (30 minutes)

---

## **SEGMENT 1: OPEN & BUILD RAPPORT (3 mins)**

### **Opening (Warm, Insider-to-Insider)**

*"Hi Angela! Great to connect. I saw you're at Truescope—I've been watching what you guys are doing in the media intelligence space, especially the positioning against legacy monitoring platforms. The AI-powered real-time angle is smart."*

*[Pause—smile, let her settle]*

*"Before we dive in, I'm curious—what stood out most from the masterclass last week? Given Truescope's footprint across Asia, ANZ and now the US, I imagine some of the multi-market orchestration stuff or proving pipeline impact probably hit close to home. What made you want to book this call?"*

**[Listen intently—this reveals her primary pain and buying motivation]**

**[Likely resonance points to listen for]:**
- Multi-market chaos ("juggling Asia, ANZ, US with different buyer dynamics")
- Proving ROI ("founders/investors want to see marketing's contribution to revenue")
- Buying committee complexity ("government and enterprise deals have 6-10 stakeholders")
- Generic messaging ("how do we speak to government vs. enterprise vs. agency buyers?")

---

### **Frame the Call (Set Expectations)**

*"Here's how I'd like to use our 30 minutes:*

*1. I'll ask you a few questions about where Truescope's marketing is today—what's working across your markets, what's keeping you up at night.*
*2. You can ask me anything about how IMPACT works for multi-market SaaS companies like yours.*
*3. By the end, we'll both know if there's a fit worth exploring—and if so, what tier makes sense (we have Pilot for proof-of-concept in one market, Regional for 3-6 markets, and Enterprise for full global orchestration)."*

*"Sound good? Great. Let me start with the most important question..."*

---

## **SEGMENT 2: DIAGNOSE & QUALIFY (15 mins)**

### **Question 1: The Current State & Primary Pain**

*"Walk me through your current marketing reality at Truescope. If I were shadowing you for a week, what would I see that's NOT working the way you need it to?"*

**[Listen for these pain signals]:**
- ✅ **Multi-market orchestration chaos** - "We're running campaigns across Asia, ANZ, US but they feel disconnected"
- ✅ **Proving ROI pressure** - "Founders/investors want to see pipeline $$$ not just MQLs or brand awareness"
- ✅ **Complex buying committees** - "Government and enterprise deals involve 6-10 people—comms, procurement, IT, legal, leadership"
- ✅ **Generic messaging doesn't resonate** - "We're using the same message for government clients in Singapore vs. enterprise in Australia vs. agencies in the US"
- ✅ **Rising CPL** - "Cost per lead keeps climbing, budget isn't growing proportionally"
- ✅ **Long sales cycles** - "Government deals take 6-12 months, hard to prove marketing's contribution"

**[Probe deeper on PRIMARY pain - use these follow-ups]:**

**If MULTI-MARKET CHAOS:**
*"Tell me more about that... Which markets are YOU personally responsible for? Is it all three regions (Asia, ANZ, US) or focused on one or two?"*

*"How are campaigns coordinated across markets right now? Separate agencies per region? One global agency? In-house with regional adaptation?"*

*"What's the cost of this fragmentation? Where are you seeing waste or duplication?"*

**If PROVING ROI:**
*"How much pressure are you feeling from founders or investors to prove marketing's pipeline contribution post-funding?"*

*"What metrics are they asking for? Pipeline dollars? Revenue attribution? Or still just lead volume and MQLs?"*

*"What's making attribution hard right now? Is it technical (systems don't sync) or cultural (Sales doesn't update CRM)?"*

**If COMPLEX BUYING COMMITTEES:**
*"Walk me through a typical Truescope deal—who's involved from the buyer's side, and when do they each engage?"*

*"Are you currently targeting just the comms/PR lead, or are you also reaching procurement, IT, legal and leadership stakeholders?"*

*"What's the difference between a government deal vs. an enterprise deal vs. an agency deal in terms of buying committee complexity?"*

**If GENERIC MESSAGING:**
*"How different are the pain points of a government PR lead in Singapore vs. an enterprise comms director in Sydney vs. an agency owner in New York?"*

*"Are you using the same messaging and creative across all three, or are you adapting?"*

*"If you're adapting, how much control do you have vs. needing HQ/founder approval?"*

---

### **Question 2: Scope & Tier Fit (Critical for Positioning)**

*"Let me get a sense of your scope. Based on what I've seen, Truescope operates across Asia, ANZ and now the US with your recent funding. Which of those markets are YOU personally responsible for driving marketing in?"*

**[Listen carefully—this determines tier fit]:**

**Scenario A: She owns 1-2 markets (e.g., APAC only)**
- → **Pilot Fit** (start with highest-priority market, prove model, scale to Regional)
- Positioning: *"That makes sense—so you're focused on [X market]. That actually fits our Pilot tier perfectly. We'd start with your highest-priority market, prove the model works over 90 days, then scale to Regional if results justify it."*

**Scenario B: She owns 3-6 markets (e.g., APAC + ANZ + US support)**
- → **Regional Fit** (but may still want Pilot as proof point first)
- Positioning: *"Got it—so you're orchestrating across 3-6 markets. That's exactly the complexity our Regional tier is built for. Some clients start with a Pilot in their highest-volume market as a proof point, then roll out regionally. Others jump straight to Regional if there's organizational urgency. Which sounds more realistic for Truescope?"*

**Scenario C: She owns all regions with full autonomy**
- → **Enterprise Fit** (or Regional with Enterprise roadmap)
- Positioning: *"Understood—you're managing full global orchestration. That's Enterprise-level complexity. We'd typically recommend starting with Regional to prove the model across your core markets, then expand to full Enterprise with custom integrations and deeper attribution."*

**Follow-up questions:**
*"And in terms of personas—when a Truescope deal closes, roughly how many stakeholder roles are typically involved? Just the comms/PR lead, or also procurement, IT, legal, leadership?"*

**[Listen for buying committee complexity]:**
- 2-3 stakeholders = simpler (less IMPACT differentiation)
- 6-10 stakeholders = IMPACT sweet spot (this is where framework shines)
- 10+ stakeholders = complex Enterprise fit

---

### **Question 3: Timeline & Urgency (Buying Intent)**

*"Given your US expansion and the recent funding round, what's driving the timing for you? Why are we having this conversation now, versus three months from now?"*

**[Listen for urgency signals]:**
- ✅ **US expansion launch** - "We need to support US pipeline immediately, launch is Q1/Q2"
- ✅ **Investor reporting** - "We need to show investors marketing ROI in next 6-12 months"
- ✅ **Pipeline pressure** - "Sales is asking for more leads, founders want to see revenue contribution"
- ✅ **Budget cycle** - "Planning FY26 budget, need to prove what marketing can deliver"
- ✅ **Competitive pressure** - "Competitors are outpacing us in [market], we need to catch up"

**[Probe for timeline]:**
*"If this were the right fit, when would you ideally want to kick off? Next month? Next quarter? Tied to a specific campaign or fiscal cycle?"*

**[If urgency is LOW]:**
*"Got it—so it sounds like this is more exploratory right now. You're gathering options but not in active buying mode. Is that fair?"*

**[Decision based on urgency]:**
- **HIGH urgency** (30-60 day timeline) → Strong fit, continue qualification
- **MODERATE urgency** (60-90 day timeline) → Good fit, may need nurturing
- **LOW urgency** (exploratory, no timeline) → Politely offer resources, stay in touch

---

### **Question 4: Budget Reality & Authority (Financial Qualification)**

*"Let me be direct about budget and authority—because I don't want to waste your time if we're not in the right ballpark."*

*"Given Truescope's stage and footprint, you're likely looking at one of two scenarios:*

1. *Pilot tier—$40K total for 90 days (1 market, 2 personas, 2 channels as proof of concept)*
2. *Regional tier—$85K for 90 days (3-6 markets, 3-4 personas, 3-4 channels as proven scale model)*

*"Where does your authority sit? Can you commit to an investment in that range, or would this need founder/leadership sign-off?"*

**[Listen for]:**
- ✅ *"I can commit to Pilot, anything above needs founder approval"* → Qualified with process (anchor to Pilot)
- ✅ *"I have influence but need to build business case for founders"* → Qualified, needs proof points
- ✅ *"Regional budget makes sense if we can prove ROI in one market first"* → Pilot → Regional path
- ❌ *"I don't control budget, would need to go through procurement/finance/founder approval process"* → Not decision-maker (ask who is)
- ❌ *"That's way more than we have for marketing programs"* → Disqualify or suggest smaller scope

**[If budget authority is unclear]:**
*"Who else would need to be involved in a decision like this? Founders? Regional MD? CFO?"*

*"Would it make sense to include them in a follow-up scoping call, or would you prefer to validate the fit first and then bring them in?"*

---

### **Question 5: Decision Process & Buying Committee (Org Complexity)**

*"If we were the right fit and you wanted to move forward, what does your internal decision process look like? Who else needs to say yes?"*

**[Listen for]:**
- ✅ *"I can make this decision for Pilot, founders for Regional+"* → Simple, fast (Pilot anchor)
- ✅ *"I'd need to loop in [Founder/CMO/Regional MD] but I drive the decision"* → Multi-step but manageable
- ❌ *"We'd need founder approval, legal review, procurement process"* → Long, complex (may need to bring founder into next call)

**[If founders need to be involved]:**
*"That makes total sense for a growth-stage company. Would it be valuable to have a follow-up conversation where we can loop in [Founder name] so they can hear the framework directly and ask questions?"*

---

## **SEGMENT 3: POSITION THE FIT (7 mins)**

### **Mirror Back What You Heard (Build Trust)**

*"Okay, let me play back what I'm hearing—tell me if I've got this right..."*

**[Customize based on her answers—here's a likely version]:**

*"You're managing marketing for [X markets—likely APAC, maybe APAC+ANZ, possibly supporting US], and right now you're dealing with [primary pain—likely multi-market orchestration chaos / proving ROI to investors / complex buying committees in government and enterprise deals].*

*You've tried [previous attempts—separate agencies per market? In-house with generic campaigns? Lead-gen tactics that don't address full buying committee?] but they haven't solved it because [root cause—fragmented execution / can't prove pipeline $$$ / messaging doesn't resonate with different buyer types].*

*The cost of not fixing this is [business impact—missed US expansion targets / can't justify marketing spend to investors / losing deals to competitors who reach full buying committee] AND [personal impact—pressure to prove marketing's value / career risk if growth targets aren't hit post-funding].*

*And you're exploring this now because [urgency driver—US expansion timeline / investor reporting / budget planning for next fiscal year]. Does that sound about right?"*

**[Wait for confirmation—this builds massive trust and shows you listened]**

---

### **Position IMPACT as the Solution (Tailored to Her Pain)**

*"Here's why I think IMPACT could be a really strong fit for Truescope..."*

**[Connect her pain to IMPACT pillars—use 2-3 max based on PRIMARY pain]**

---

**IF PRIMARY PAIN = MULTI-MARKET ORCHESTRATION CHAOS:**

*"The challenge you're facing—running campaigns across Asia, ANZ and now the US with different buyer dynamics—is exactly what the 'A' in IMPACT solves: **Agile, Integrated Media**.*

*Right now, you're probably running separate campaigns per market, which means:*
- *You're paying cold-audience CPL rates in every region (because you can't retarget engaged audiences across market silos)*
- *You're duplicating creative and messaging work (same campaign rebuilt 3 times instead of intelligently adapted once)*
- *You have no unified view of what's working where (each market reports separately)*

*What IMPACT does is build **ONE integrated funnel** that sequences brand → demand across all your markets. You still adapt messaging locally (we'll talk about that), but the underlying funnel structure, budget orchestration, and attribution system is unified.*

*The result: 20-40% lower CPL because you're nurturing warm audiences, not starting cold every time. And **one dashboard** that shows founders/investors which markets and channels drive pipeline $$, not just MQLs."*

---

**IF PRIMARY PAIN = PROVING ROI TO INVESTORS/FOUNDERS:**

*"The reason you can't prove marketing's pipeline contribution right now is likely two-fold:*

*1. **Technical** - Your MA, CRM, and ad platforms don't sync, so you're stitching together three contradicting dashboards every month*
*2. **Strategic** - You're probably being measured on MQLs or demo requests, but founders/investors want to see **closed revenue**, not top-of-funnel metrics*

*That's the 'T' in IMPACT—**Track Success**. We build full-funnel attribution that connects every marketing touchpoint (LinkedIn ad → content download → webinar → demo request) to actual pipeline dollars and closed deals.*

*For a growth-stage SaaS company like Truescope, this means you walk into investor updates with data that says: 'Marketing influenced $X in pipeline this quarter, drove $Y in closed revenue, and here's the channel breakdown.'*

*No more defending vanity metrics. You're speaking their language: revenue."*

---

**IF PRIMARY PAIN = COMPLEX BUYING COMMITTEES (GOVERNMENT/ENTERPRISE):**

*"The challenge with government and enterprise Truescope deals is that 6-10 people need to say yes—comms/PR lead, procurement, IT, legal, leadership—and they all care about completely different things.*

*A comms director in Singapore cares about **real-time monitoring and sentiment analysis**.*
*Procurement cares about **vendor vetting and contract terms**.*
*IT cares about **security, data privacy, integrations with existing systems**.*
*Leadership cares about **ROI and business case**.*

*Right now, you're probably targeting just the comms/PR lead (the 'champion'), but missing the other 5-9 influencers and blockers. That's why deals stall or go dark.*

*That's the 'I' in IMPACT—**Insight-Driven Audiences**. We map your full buying committee (based on your last 10-20 closed deals—wins and losses), then build targeting and messaging that reaches ALL of them, not just one.*

*And the 'M'—**Message Personalisation**—ensures each stakeholder hears what THEY care about:*
- *Comms lead: 'Real-time monitoring across 45+ markets'*
- *Procurement: 'Trusted by 250+ government and enterprise clients'*
- *IT: 'API integrations with existing workflows, SOC2 compliant'*
- *Leadership: 'Save 15 hours/week per comms team member'*

*Same product. Different resonance. That's how you close government and enterprise deals faster."*

---

### **Explain the Tier Fit (Based on Her Scope)**

**IF SHE OWNS 1-2 MARKETS (PILOT FIT):**

*"Given you're focused on [X market], here's what I'd recommend:*

*Start with **IMPACT Pilot**—90 days, one market (your highest-priority, likely APAC or whichever drives most revenue), 2 personas, 2 channels (Search + LinkedIn).*

*The investment is **$40K total** ($25K strategy buildout + $5K/month media for 3 months).*

*By Day 90, you'll have:*
- *20-30% CPL reduction (benchmark)*
- *28%+ pipeline growth (benchmark)*
- *Full attribution showing founders/investors which campaigns drove pipeline $$$*
- *A proven model ready to scale to Regional (APAC + ANZ + US)*

*If the numbers work, we expand to Regional tier. If they don't, you've tested at the smallest scope possible. Make sense?"*

---

**IF SHE OWNS 3-6 MARKETS (REGIONAL FIT):**

*"Given you're orchestrating across [3-6 markets], here's what I'd recommend:*

*You have two options:*

*1. **Start with Pilot** ($40K, 90 days, 1 market) as a proof point, then roll out to Regional once you've proven ROI to founders*
*2. **Jump straight to Regional** ($85K, 90 days, 3-6 markets, 3-4 personas, 3-4 channels) if there's organizational urgency and you have founder buy-in*

*Most clients in your situation choose Option 1—prove the model in APAC (highest volume), show founders the 20-30% CPL reduction and pipeline lift, then get approval to scale regionally.*

*But if you're under time pressure to support US expansion immediately, or if founders are already aligned on the investment, Option 2 lets you hit all markets at once.*

*Which path feels more realistic for Truescope?"*

---

### **Address Objections Proactively (Anticipate Her Concerns)**

**OBJECTION 1: "We've tried agencies before—they promised results but didn't deliver"**

*"I hear that all the time, especially from sophisticated in-house marketers like you. Here's why IMPACT is different:*

*1. **It's a 90-day proof point, not a 12-month retainer.** By Month 1 you see baseline performance, Month 2 you see optimization, Month 3 you see proof of ROI. If the numbers don't show 20-30% CPL reduction and measurable pipeline lift, we haven't earned the right to continue.*

*2. **You get a dedicated Growth Pod—strategist, media specialist, creative lead—not rotating account managers.** This is YOUR team for the full engagement.*

*3. **You get a live ROI dashboard—not month-end Excel files.** You see CPL, pipeline, and channel performance in real-time.*

*Fair?"*

---

**OBJECTION 2: "I don't have time to onboard another vendor right now"**

*"Totally get it—your plate is full supporting US expansion, APAC campaigns, and probably a hundred other things.*

*Here's what makes Phase 1 efficient:*
- *Week 0 is a **4-hour kickoff** where we capture everything we need (we pre-fill most of the client brief from this call and any prep materials you send)*
- *Weeks 1-2, **our team does the heavy lifting**—persona research, media planning, creative framework—you review and approve*
- *By Week 3, campaigns launch*

*Most clients actually say it's LESS work than managing multiple agencies or freelancers because we own the orchestration end-to-end. You're reviewing and approving, not project-managing."*

---

**OBJECTION 3: "I need founder approval for $40K+ decisions"**

*"That makes total sense for a growth-stage company, especially post-funding.*

*Here's what other clients in your situation have done:*

*We run this initial call (what we're doing now) to make sure there's a fit. If it makes sense to both of us, we do a 60-minute **scoping call** where we deep-dive into your current setup, walk through exactly what Phase 1 would look like for Truescope, and build a business case you can take to founders.*

*Then, if you want, we can do a **30-minute founder call** where they can hear the framework directly, ask questions, and pressure-test the ROI assumptions.*

*Would that sequencing work—us → you → founders?"*

---

**OBJECTION 4: "How is this different from [lead-gen agency / demand-gen agency / HubSpot partner]?"**

*"Great question. Most agencies focus on **volume**—they'll run LinkedIn ads, optimize CPL, send you leads.*

*IMPACT is built for a different challenge: **Southeast Asian and multi-market buying committee complexity**.*

*That means:*
1. *Targeting the full 6-10 stakeholder buying committee (comms, procurement, IT, legal, leadership), not just the champion*
2. *Creating persona-specific messaging that resonates differently with a government PR lead in Singapore vs. an enterprise comms director in Sydney vs. an agency owner in New York*
3. *Building one integrated funnel that sequences brand → demand across multiple markets (so you're not starting cold every quarter)*
4. *Full attribution that proves pipeline contribution to founders/investors, not just MQL delivery*

*If your challenge is 'we need more demo requests,' a typical lead-gen agency might be fine.*

*If your challenge is 'we're orchestrating across multiple markets with complex buying committees and can't prove ROI,' that's where IMPACT is purpose-built for companies like Truescope."*

---

## **SEGMENT 4: CLOSE & NEXT STEPS (5 mins)**

### **Ask for the Next Step (If Qualified)**

*"So here's what I'm thinking based on our conversation..."*

**[IF STRONG FIT]:**

*"I think there's a really good fit here. Truescope's multi-market complexity, your focus on proving ROI post-funding, and the buying committee dynamics with government and enterprise clients—that's exactly what IMPACT was designed to solve.*

*The next step would be a **60-minute scoping call** where we:*
1. *Deep-dive into your current tech stack (MA, CRM, ad platforms—what's syncing, what's not)*
2. *Walk through your historical performance data (CPL trends, lead volume, conversion rates by market)*
3. *Map out exactly what Phase 1 would look like for Truescope—which market(s) to start with, which personas, what deliverables you'd get*
4. *And if it makes sense to both of us, we'd draft a proposal you can take to founders*

*Does that sound like a logical next step?"*

**[IF YES]:**
*"Great. I'm looking at my calendar—does [Day/Time] or [Day/Time] work for you? I'll send an invite and a short **prep doc** so you know what data and access info to have ready."*

**[IF HESITATES]:**
*"What questions or concerns do you have before we schedule that next conversation?"*

**[Address concerns, then try close again OR acknowledge timing]:**
*"No problem—sounds like you need to [check with founders / validate budget / etc.]. Why don't I send you [relevant case study / IMPACT framework PDF / ROI calculator], and you ping me when timing makes sense?"*

---

### **IF SCOPE NEEDS CLARIFICATION (Not Yet Qualified):**

*"Based on what you've shared, I want to make sure we're positioning the right tier for your actual scope.*

*It sounds like you're managing [X markets] with [Y personas] and [Z buying committee complexity].*

*Before we jump into a scoping call, let me send you:*
1. *A **tier comparison sheet** (Pilot vs. Regional vs. Enterprise) so you can see where Truescope fits*
2. *A **case study** from [most relevant client—maybe another SaaS company or multi-market B2B]*
3. *A **5-question pre-scoping survey** to help us both be more efficient on the next call*

*Once you've reviewed those, ping me and we'll schedule the deep-dive. Fair?"*

---

### **IF NOT A FIT (Polite Disqualification - Unlikely Given Truescope Profile):**

*"Based on what you've shared, I want to be honest—IMPACT might not be the right fit for where you are right now. Here's why..."*

**[Only use if genuinely not a fit—e.g., if she reveals:]**
- She's only managing 1 simple market with 1 persona (too simple for IMPACT)
- She has zero budget authority and can't bring founders into conversation
- She's looking for brand/creative work, not performance marketing

*"You'd be better served by [alternative recommendation if you have one]. But if your scope or authority changes, feel free to reach back out."*

---

### **End on a Helpful Note**

*"Even if we don't end up working together, let me share a couple things that might help with your immediate challenge..."*

**[Provide 1-2 actionable tips based on her PRIMARY pain]:**

**If multi-market orchestration:**
*"For your multi-market challenge, try unifying your retargeting audiences across regions—even if campaigns are separate, you can build lookalike audiences from engaged users in APAC and deploy them in ANZ and US. You'll see 20-40% lower CPL on warm vs. cold targeting."*

**If proving ROI:**
*"For your attribution challenge, use a BI layer like Looker Studio or Power BI to pull MA + CRM + ad platform data into ONE view. You don't need full backend integration—just a unified dashboard that lets you show founders: 'Here are the campaigns that influenced pipeline $$ this quarter.'"*

**If buying committee complexity:**
*"For your buying committee challenge, map your last 10 closed deals (wins and losses) and identify which roles appeared in 80%+ of wins. Then build separate targeting campaigns for those roles on LinkedIn—you'll be shocked how much it reduces deal cycle time when you're not just relying on champions to evangelize internally."*

## KEY TALKING POINTS - TRUESCOPE SPECIFIC

### **Tier Recommendation (Based on Call):**

**OPTION A: Start with Pilot → Scale to Regional**
- *"Given Truescope's stage and the need to prove ROI to founders post-funding, I'd recommend starting with **Pilot** ($40K, 90 days) in your highest-priority market (likely APAC). Prove 20-30% CPL reduction and pipeline lift. Then use those results to get founder buy-in for Regional rollout across APAC + ANZ + US."*

**OPTION B: Jump to Regional (If Urgency + Founder Buy-In Exists)**
- *"If there's immediate pressure to support US expansion and founders are already aligned on marketing investment, we could jump straight to **Regional** ($85K, 90 days) covering 3-6 markets with integrated orchestration from Day 1."*

**Anchor:** Start with Option A (Pilot), offer Option B if she signals high urgency + founder alignment.

---

### **Proof Points Most Relevant to Angela:**

1. **SAP SEA** - Multi-market B2B SaaS, 22% CPL reduction, 28% pipeline growth (closest match to Truescope)
2. **NUS AIDF** - Complex buying committees (education sector), 47% conversion lift, 34% CPL reduction
3. **Singapore Fintech** - SaaS company, 18% CAC reduction, 45% engagement lift (SaaS peer proof)

**Use SAP SEA as primary case study—most analogous to Truescope's situation.**

---

### **Truescope-Specific Pain → IMPACT Pillar Mapping:**

| Angela's Likely Pain | IMPACT Pillar | Key Talking Point |
|---------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Multi-market orchestration chaos (Asia, ANZ, US) | **A** - Agile, Integrated Media | "One unified funnel sequences brand → demand across all markets, no more starting cold every region" |
| Proving ROI to investors/founders post-funding | **T** - Track Success | "Full-funnel attribution shows which campaigns drove pipeline $$ and closed revenue, not just MQLs" |
| Complex buying committees (govt + enterprise) | **I** - Insight-Driven Audiences | "Target all 6-10 stakeholders (comms, procurement, IT, legal, leadership), not just champion" |
| Generic messaging doesn't resonate | **M** - Message Personalisation | "Persona-specific messaging for govt vs. enterprise vs. agency buyers, adapted per market" |
| Rising CPL, budget pressure | **A + C** - Integrated Media + Continuous Testing | "20-30% CPL reduction through warm audience retargeting + weekly testing sprints" |

---

### **Questions Angela Will Likely Ask You:**

**Q: "How long does Phase 1 actually take? Can we launch in 30 days?"**

**A:** *"Phase 1 is 15 working days (3 weeks). Week 0 is Discovery (kickoff, data collection, brand guidelines). Week 1 is Strategy (persona research, messaging, channel selection). Week 2 is Build (media plan, creative framework). By Week 3 (Day 16), campaigns launch. So yes, we can go from kickoff to live campaigns in about 30 calendar days."*

---

**Q: "What if founders want to be involved in the process?"**

**A:** *"Totally fine—we actually encourage it for growth-stage companies. Here's how we'd structure it:*
1. *This initial call (you + me) validates fit*
2. *60-min scoping call (you + me + optionally a founder) deep-dives into deliverables and ROI model*
3. *We draft proposal with clear ROI assumptions*
4. *Optional 30-min founder Q&A call if they want to pressure-test the framework*
5. *Contract + Kickoff*

*Most founders appreciate being looped in early so they can shape the Pilot scope rather than reviewing after the fact."*

---

**Q: "Can you work with our existing agencies or do you replace them?"**

**A:** *"We typically replace, but can integrate if there's a strong strategic reason. Here's why:*

*If you have regional agencies handling creative production or local execution, we can work with them—we'd own strategy, media planning, and attribution, they'd handle execution under our framework.*

*But most clients find it's simpler and more cost-effective to consolidate with us because:*
1. *You eliminate coordination overhead (no more herding agencies across markets)*
2. *We own end-to-end orchestration (strategy → execution → optimization → reporting)*
3. *One Growth Pod vs. multiple agency relationships to manage*

*What's your current agency setup—one global partner, regional partners, or fully in-house?"*

---

**Q: "What access do you need to our systems?"**

**A:** *"For Phase 1, we need:*

***Must-Have (Week 0):***
- *Google Ads admin access (or Campaign Manager)*
- *LinkedIn Campaign Manager admin access*
- *Google Analytics view access (or whatever analytics platform you use)*

***Good-to-Have (Week 1):***
- *Marketing automation platform (HubSpot, Marketo, Pardot) read access for historical lead data*
- *CRM (Salesforce, HubSpot CRM) export of last 15-20 closed deals (anonymized is fine)*

***Nice-to-Have (Week 2):***
- *Brand asset library (logos, fonts, templates)*
- *Historical campaign data (past performance reports)*

*We'd send you a detailed checklist after the scoping call with exactly what we need and by when. Most clients can provision this in 3-5 days."*

## ANGELA-SPECIFIC TACTICAL NOTES

### **Her Sophistication = Talk Like a Peer, Not a Vendor:**

Angela is 8-10+ years in, data-driven, probably knows more about MA platforms, attribution models, and funnel metrics than most agency account managers. Don't oversimplify or talk down to her.

**DO:**
- Use specific metrics: "CPL, MQL → SQL conversion, pipeline contribution, CAC"
- Reference platforms: "HubSpot, Salesforce, LinkedIn Campaign Manager, Looker Studio"
- Ask technical questions: "What's your current attribution model—first-touch, last-touch, or multi-touch?"

**DON'T:**
- Explain basic concepts: "So a lead is when someone fills out a form..."
- Overpromise with vague claims: "We'll get you way more leads!"
- Use jargon without substance: "We leverage AI-powered synergistic frameworks..."

---

### **Truescope Buyer Personas (Her Customers) - Reference If Relevant:**

Understanding who Truescope SELLS to helps you understand her buying committee complexity and messaging challenges:

1. **Government PR/Comms Teams** - Long cycles, procurement-heavy, risk-averse, compliance-focused
2. **Enterprise Comms Directors** - Multiple stakeholders, integration concerns, ROI-focused
3. **PR Agencies** - Volume buyers, need white-label capabilities, price-sensitive
4. **Corporate Affairs / IR Teams** - Reputation management, crisis response, senior-level buyers

**If she brings up her customers, mirror this back:**
*"So when you're selling to a government comms team, you've got procurement, IT security, legal compliance, and leadership all weighing in—that's exactly the buying committee complexity IMPACT is built to navigate. We'd map YOUR buying committee for media intelligence platforms, but the framework is the same."*

---

### **Founder Context (If You Get Their Names):**

Truescope is privately held, so founders/leadership are likely deeply involved in marketing decisions, especially post-funding. If Angela mentions specific names, research them on LinkedIn before scoping call.

**Questions to ask if founders come up:**
- *"Which founder or exec is most focused on marketing and growth strategy?"*
- *"How hands-on are they? Do they want to review deliverables weekly or just see results monthly?"*
- *"What's their biggest concern about marketing right now—cost, pipeline contribution, or speed of execution?"*

## FINAL PRE-CALL REMINDERS

### **Your Posture:**
- **Consultative, not salesy** - You're diagnosing a peer's challenge, not pitching
- **Confident, not desperate** - IMPACT isn't for everyone, and that's okay
- **Helpful, even if no deal** - Build long-term relationship, she may refer others or come back later
- **Qualify hard** - Better to position Regional honestly than overpromise with Pilot

### **What Success Looks Like:**
- ✅ She feels heard and understood (you mirrored her pain accurately)
- ✅ You've diagnosed tier fit (Pilot vs. Regional)
- ✅ You've confirmed budget authority and decision process
- ✅ You've booked scoping call OR have clear next step
- ✅ She sees you as a peer/expert, not a vendor

### **What Failure Looks Like:**
- ❌ You pitched IMPACT without diagnosing her specific pain
- ❌ You positioned wrong tier (Pilot when she needs Regional, or vice versa)
- ❌ You didn't qualify budget authority and waste time on scoping call
- ❌ She sees you as "another agency" trying to sell her

---

**You're ready. This is a strong lead. Trust the process, listen deeply, and position IMPACT as the solution to HER specific multi-market buying committee orchestration challenge.**

**Good luck, Charan!**
