---

## QUICK CONTEXT

**Angela:** Senior Marketing Lead, 8-10 yrs exp, data-driven, APAC focus
**Truescope:** Media intelligence SaaS, 51-200 employees, $6.2M funding, markets: Asia/ANZ/US
**Buyers:** Govt PR teams, Enterprise Comms, Agencies (6-10 stakeholder committees)
**Hypothesis:** Multi-market orchestration chaos + proving ROI to investors + complex buying committees

**Expected Tier:** Regional (3-6 markets) or Pilot → Regional path

---

## OPENING (3 mins)

*"Hi Angela! Truescope's AI-powered positioning against legacy platforms is smart. From the masterclass, what stood out most—multi-market orchestration or proving pipeline impact?"*

[Listen for primary pain, then frame the call]

---

## 5 QUALIFYING QUESTIONS (15 mins)

### **Q1: Current Pain** (Open-Ended Discovery)
*"Walk me through your marketing reality. If I shadowed you for a week, what's NOT working?"*

**Listen for:**
- ✅ Multi-market chaos (Asia/ANZ/US disconnect)
- ✅ Proving ROI to investors/founders post-funding
- ✅ Complex buying committees (govt/enterprise = 6-10 stakeholders)
- ✅ Generic messaging doesn't resonate
- ✅ Rising CPL, can't show attribution

**Probe:** *"Tell me more... How long has this been an issue? What have you tried? What's the cost of NOT fixing this?"*

---

### **Q2: Scope & Tier Fit** (CRITICAL - Determines Positioning)
*"Which markets are YOU personally responsible for? All three regions (Asia/ANZ/US) or focused on one or two?"*

**Listen for tier signals:**
- **1-2 markets** → Pilot ($40K, 90 days, 1 market proof)
- **3-6 markets** → Regional ($85K, 90 days, full orchestration)
- **6+ markets** → Enterprise (custom)

*"When a Truescope deal closes, how many stakeholder roles typically involved? Just comms lead or also procurement, IT, legal, leadership?"*

**Listen for:**
- 6-10 stakeholders = IMPACT sweet spot ✅
- 2-3 stakeholders = less complexity

---

### **Q3: Urgency & Timeline** (Buying Intent)
*"Given US expansion and recent funding, why now vs. three months from now?"*

**Listen for urgency signals:**
- ✅ US expansion launch pressure
- ✅ Investor/founder ROI reporting
- ✅ Pipeline targets not being hit
- ✅ Budget planning for FY26

*"If this were right fit, when would you ideally kick off? Next month? Next quarter?"*

**Decision:**
- HIGH urgency (30-60 days) → Strong fit, push for scoping call
- LOW urgency (exploratory) → Nurture, send resources

---

### **Q4: Budget & Authority** (Financial Qualification)
*"Let me be direct about budget. Given Truescope's stage, you're looking at:*
- *Pilot: $40K total (1 market, 90 days, proof of concept)*
- *Regional: $85K total (3-6 markets, 90 days, full scale)*

*Where does your authority sit? Can you commit to Pilot, or need founder approval?"*

**Listen for:**
- ✅ "I can commit to Pilot" = Strong authority
- ✅ "Need founder buy-in for $40K+" = Qualified with process
- ❌ "No budget authority" = Ask who does

*"Who else needs to say yes? Founders? CFO?"*

---

### **Q5: Decision Process** (Org Complexity)
*"If we were right fit and you wanted to move forward, what's your internal decision process?"*

**Listen for:**
- ✅ "I drive decision, loop in founders" = Fast
- ✅ "Founders need to approve" = Multi-step but manageable
- ❌ "Complex procurement/legal process" = Long cycle

---

## POSITIONING (7 mins)

### **Mirror Back** (Trust-Building)
*"Let me play back what I'm hearing... You're managing [X markets], dealing with [primary pain], tried [previous attempts] but [root cause]. Cost is [business + personal impact]. Timing driven by [urgency]. Right?"*

[Wait for confirmation]

---

### **Position IMPACT** (Match to Her Pain - Pick 1-2 Max)

**IF MULTI-MARKET CHAOS:**
*"The 'A' in IMPACT—Agile Integrated Media—builds ONE funnel across Asia/ANZ/US. You stop starting cold every region. Result: 20-40% lower CPL, one dashboard founders trust."*

**IF PROVING ROI:**
*"The 'T'—Track Success—connects every touchpoint to pipeline $$. You walk into investor updates saying: 'Marketing influenced $X pipeline, drove $Y revenue, here's the breakdown.'"*

**IF COMPLEX BUYING COMMITTEES:**
*"The 'I'—Insight-Driven Audiences + 'M'—Message Personalisation target all 6-10 stakeholders (comms, procurement, IT, legal, leadership) with persona-specific messaging. Govt lead hears monitoring coverage, procurement hears 250+ client validation, IT hears SOC2 compliance."*

---

### **Tier Recommendation**

**OPTION A: Pilot → Regional** (Safest Anchor)
*"Given Truescope's stage and need to prove ROI to founders, start with Pilot ($40K, 90 days, highest-priority market). Prove 20-30% CPL reduction. Use results to get buy-in for Regional rollout."*

**OPTION B: Jump to Regional** (If High Urgency + Founder Buy-In)
*"If there's immediate US expansion pressure and founders are aligned, jump to Regional ($85K, 3-6 markets). Which feels more realistic?"*

---

## OBJECTION HANDLING (As Needed)

**"We've tried agencies before"**
→ *"90-day proof point, not 12-month retainer. If numbers don't show 20-30% CPL reduction by Day 90, we haven't earned the right to continue."*

**"Need founder approval"**
→ *"Makes sense. We'd do scoping call (you + me), build business case, then optional 30-min founder Q&A. Sound good?"*

**"Don't have time to onboard another vendor"**
→ *"Week 0 is 4-hour kickoff. Weeks 1-2 we do heavy lifting (persona research, media planning). By Week 3, campaigns launch. Less work than managing multiple agencies."*

**"How is this different from lead-gen agencies?"**
→ *"They focus on volume. IMPACT is built for multi-market buying committee complexity: targeting all 6-10 stakeholders, persona-specific messaging, integrated funnel, full attribution to prove pipeline $$."*

---

## CLOSE (5 mins)

### **Ask for Scoping Call** (If Qualified)
*"I think there's a strong fit. Next step: 60-min scoping call where we deep-dive into your tech stack, historical performance, and map exactly what Phase 1 would look like for Truescope. Then draft proposal you can take to founders. Sound good?"*

**If YES:**
*"Great. Does [Day/Time] or [Day/Time] work? I'll send invite + prep doc."*

**If HESITATE:**
*"What questions or concerns before we schedule?"*

---

### **If Needs Time**
*"No problem. Let me send you [tier comparison / SAP case study / ROI calculator]. Ping me when timing makes sense."*

---

## CONVERSATION POSTURE

✅ **Consultative, not salesy** - Diagnose like a peer
✅ **Confident, not desperate** - IMPACT isn't for everyone
✅ **Talk metrics** - CPL, MQL→SQL, pipeline $$, attribution
✅ **Qualify hard** - Better to position Regional honestly than overpromise Pilot

❌ **Don't oversimplify** - She's sophisticated (8-10 yrs, data-driven)
❌ **Don't pitch features** - Focus on her pain → solution
❌ **Don't assume Pilot** - Could be Regional given footprint

---

## LIKELY QUESTIONS SHE'LL ASK

**"How long does Phase 1 take?"**
→ *"15 working days (3 weeks). Week 0: Discovery. Week 1: Strategy. Week 2: Build. Campaigns launch Week 3 (Day 16). So ~30 calendar days kickoff to live."*

**"Can you work with our existing agencies?"**
→ *"We typically replace for simplicity, but can integrate if strategic reason. Most clients consolidate with us to eliminate coordination overhead. What's your current setup?"*

**"What access do you need?"**
→ *"Must-have: Google Ads + LinkedIn Campaign Manager admin. Good-to-have: MA + CRM export of last 20 deals. We send detailed checklist after scoping."*
