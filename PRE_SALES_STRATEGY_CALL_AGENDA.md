## CALL STRUCTURE (30 minutes)

---

## **SEGMENT 1: OPEN & BUILD RAPPORT (3 mins)**

### **Opening (Warm, Human)**

*"Hi [Name], good to see you! Thanks for carving out time today. I know your schedule's packed—juggling campaigns, HQ calls, Sales asks—so I appreciate you making space for this."*

*[Pause—smile, let them settle]*

*"Before we dive in, I'm curious—what stood out most from the masterclass? Was there a specific pain point or framework piece that made you think 'okay, I need to explore this further'?"*

**[Listen intently—this reveals their primary pain and buying motivation]**

---

### **Frame the Call (Set Expectations)**

*"Here's how I'd like to use our 30 minutes together:*

*1. I'll ask you a few questions about where you are today—your current challenges, what's working, what's not.*
*2. You can ask me anything about how IMPACT actually works in practice.*
*3. By the end, we'll both know if there's a fit worth exploring further—and if so, what the next step looks like."*

*"Sound good? Great. Let me start with the most important question..."*

---

## **SEGMENT 2: DIAGNOSE & QUALIFY (15 mins)**

### **Question 1: The Current State (Pain Discovery)**

*"Walk me through your current marketing reality. If I were shadowing you for a week, what would I see that's NOT working the way you need it to?"*

**[Listen for these pain signals]:**
- ✅ Rising CPL / flat or shrinking budget
- ✅ Generic HQ campaigns that don't resonate locally
- ✅ Poor lead quality complaints from Sales
- ✅ Can't prove marketing's revenue contribution
- ✅ Fragmented execution across multiple markets
- ✅ No time to test / optimize / learn

**[Probe deeper on their PRIMARY pain]:**
- *"Tell me more about that..."*
- *"How long has this been an issue?"*
- *"What have you tried so far to fix it?"*
- *"What's the cost of NOT solving this? To the business? To you personally?"*

**[Red Flags—Polite Disqualification Signals]:**
- ❌ They're looking for brand campaigns / creative storytelling (not performance marketing)
- ❌ They don't have budget authority or decision-making power
- ❌ They're only managing 1 market with 1 persona (too simple for IMPACT value)
- ❌ They want a "done for you" solution but no strategic partnership

---

### **Question 2: The Scope & Fit (Service Tier Qualification)**

*"Let me get a sense of your scope. How many markets are you responsible for right now?"*

**[Listen for tier fit]:**
- **Pilot Fit:** 1-2 markets, testing new approach, need proof of concept
- **Regional Fit:** 3-6 markets, proven model ready to scale
- **Enterprise Fit:** 6+ markets, complex org, custom integration needs

*"And in terms of personas—how many different buyer roles are typically involved in your deals? IT, procurement, finance, ops...?"*

**[Gauge buying committee complexity]:**
- 2-3 stakeholders = simpler deal (Pilot fit)
- 6-10 stakeholders = complex B2B (IMPACT sweet spot)
- Single decision-maker = not ideal fit (IMPACT built for buying committees)

---

### **Question 3: The Timeline & Urgency (Buying Intent)**

*"What's driving the timing for you? Why are we having this conversation now, versus three months from now?"*

**[Listen for urgency signals]:**
- ✅ Q1/Q4 planning cycle approaching
- ✅ Board pressure on marketing ROI
- ✅ Upcoming campaign launches that need better strategy
- ✅ New fiscal year budget to allocate
- ✅ Peer got promoted / they're feeling career pressure

**[If urgency is low]:**
*"Got it. So it sounds like this is more exploratory right now—you're gathering options but not in active buying mode. Is that fair?"*

**[Decision]:**
- If **NO urgency:** *"No problem. Let me send you some resources. Feel free to reach out when timing makes more sense."* [Polite exit]
- If **HIGH urgency:** Continue qualification.

---

### **Question 4: The Budget Reality (Financial Qualification)**

*"Let me be direct about budget—because I don't want to waste your time if we're not in the right ballpark."*

*"Our Pilot tier engagement—which is designed for 1 market, 2 personas, 2 channels (Search + LinkedIn)—is $25K for the 90-day strategy buildout, plus $5K/month in media spend. So you're looking at about $40K total investment for a 90-day proof of concept."*

*"Does that range make sense for what you're trying to solve? Or is that outside what you have authority to spend?"*

**[Listen for:]**
- ✅ *"Yes, that's within range"* → Qualified lead
- ✅ *"I'd need to get approval, but that's doable"* → Qualified with process
- ❌ *"That's way more than we have"* → Polite disqualification
- ❌ *"I don't control budget"* → Not decision-maker (ask who does)

**[If budget authority is unclear]:**
*"Who else needs to be involved in a decision like this? CFO? VP Marketing?"*

**[Decision]:**
- If they control or influence budget → Continue
- If they have no budget authority and can't bring decision-maker in → Polite exit

---

### **Question 5: The Decision Process (Org Complexity)**

*"If we were the right fit and you wanted to move forward, what does your decision process look like? Who else needs to say yes?"*

**[Listen for:]**
- ✅ *"I can make this decision"* → Simple, fast
- ✅ *"I'd need to loop in [VP/CFO]"* → Multi-step but manageable
- ❌ *"We'd need global approval, procurement review, legal..."* → Long, complex (unlikely Pilot fit—maybe Regional/Enterprise later)

---

## **SEGMENT 3: POSITION THE FIT (7 mins)**

### **Mirror Back What You Heard**

*"Okay, let me play back what I'm hearing—and you tell me if I've got this right..."*

*"You're managing [X markets], dealing with [primary pain], and right now [specific challenge]. You've tried [previous attempts] but they haven't solved it because [root cause]. The cost of not fixing this is [business + personal impact]. And you're exploring this now because [urgency driver]. Does that sound about right?"*

**[Wait for confirmation—this builds trust and shows you listened]**

---

### **Position IMPACT as the Solution**

*"Here's why I think IMPACT could be a fit for you..."*

**[Connect their pain to IMPACT pillars—use 2-3 max, not all 6]:**

**Example 1 (If pain = rising CPL + can't prove ROI):**
*"The reason your CPL keeps climbing is likely because you're starting cold every quarter—brand and demand budgets are separate, so you can't retarget warm audiences. That's the 'A' in IMPACT—Agile, Integrated Media. We build one unified funnel that sequences brand → demand, so you're always nurturing warm audiences at lower CPL. And the 'T'—Track Success—means you'll finally have attribution that shows the CFO which campaigns drove pipeline dollars, not just MQLs."*

**Example 2 (If pain = generic HQ messaging doesn't resonate):**
*"The challenge you're facing with HQ's templates is classic—they're built for North America, not SEA buying committees. That's the 'M' in IMPACT—Message Personalisation. We don't ask you to fight HQ for approval. Instead, we create smart micro-variations that speak to what a CFO in Jakarta, a CIO in Singapore, and an Ops Director in Manila each care about—while staying within HQ's brand framework. And the 'I'—Insight-Driven Audiences—ensures we're targeting the full buying committee, not just IT."*

**Example 3 (If pain = fragmented execution across markets):**
*"What you're describing—juggling 6 platforms across multiple markets with no integrated plan—that's exactly what IMPACT was designed to solve. The 'A'—Agile, Integrated Media—gives you one unified funnel plan. The 'C'—Continuous Testing—means weekly optimization sprints, not quarterly fire-drills. And the 'T'—Track Success—connects all your fragmented data (CRM, MA, ad platforms) into one dashboard everyone trusts."*

---

### **Explain the Pilot Tier (If They're a Fit)**

*"Given what you've shared, I think the **Pilot tier** makes the most sense as a starting point. Here's why:"*

*"Pilot is designed for exactly your situation—1 market, 2 personas, 2 channels (Search + LinkedIn). It's a 90-day proof of concept. By the end, you'll know whether IMPACT delivers the CPL reduction, pipeline lift, and ROI clarity we talked about. If it works, we scale to Regional tier (3-6 markets). If it doesn't, you've tested it at the smallest scope possible."*

*"The investment is $25K for the strategy buildout (that's the full Phase 1—buying-group research, messaging architecture, 90-day media plan, creative framework), plus $5K/month in media spend. So $40K total for 90 days."*

*"What you get is a dedicated Growth Pod—strategist, media specialist, creative lead—working with your team. Weekly optimization calls. Live ROI dashboard. And most importantly: a system you can prove works before scaling it across SEA."*

---

### **Address Objections Proactively**

**Objection 1: "We've tried agencies before, they overpromise and underdeliver"**

*"I hear that—and honestly, that's why we structure Pilot as a 90-day proof point, not a 12-month retainer. You'll see results in Month 1 (launch + baseline), Month 2 (optimize + scale), Month 3 (prove ROI). If the numbers don't show 20-30% CPL reduction and measurable pipeline lift by Day 90, we haven't earned the right to continue. Fair?"*

---

**Objection 2: "I don't have time to onboard another vendor right now"**

*"I get it—your plate's full. That's exactly why Phase 1 is designed to be efficient. Week 0 is a 4-hour kickoff where we capture everything we need. Week 1 and 2, our team does the heavy lifting—persona research, media planning, creative framework. You review and approve. By Week 3, campaigns launch. Most clients say it's less work than managing their current fragmented agency setup because we own the orchestration."*

---

**Objection 3: "I need HQ approval / legal review / procurement process"**

*"Totally understand. Here's what other clients in similar situations have done: We run a 'Pilot within the Pilot'—start with one market (whichever has the most autonomy), prove the model works, then use those results to get HQ buy-in for broader rollout. Would that work here?"*

---

## **SEGMENT 4: CLOSE & NEXT STEPS (5 mins)**

### **Ask for the Next Step (If Qualified)**

*"So here's what I'm thinking based on our conversation..."*

**[If they're a strong fit]:**

*"I think there's a really good fit here. The next step would be a 60-minute scoping call where we:*
1. *Deep-dive into your current setup—tech stack, team structure, campaign history*
2. *Walk through exactly what Phase 1 would look like for your specific situation*
3. *Answer any detailed questions about process, deliverables, timelines*
4. *And if it makes sense to both of us, we'd draft a proposal.*

*"Does that sound like a logical next step?"*

**[If yes]:**
*"Great. I'm looking at my calendar—does [Day/Time] or [Day/Time] work for you? I'll send an invite and a short prep doc so you know what to have ready."*

**[If they hesitate]:**
*"What questions or concerns do you have before we schedule that next conversation?"*

**[Address concerns, then try close again OR politely exit if not ready]**

---

### **If They're NOT a Fit (Polite Disqualification)**

*"Based on what you've shared, I don't think IMPACT is the right fit for where you are right now. Here's why..."*

**[Be honest and helpful]:**
- *"You're only managing 1 market with 1 persona—that's too simple for the IMPACT framework. You'd be paying for complexity you don't need. I'd recommend [simpler alternative]."*
- *"Your primary challenge is brand storytelling / creative design, which isn't our core strength. We focus on performance marketing—CPL reduction, pipeline attribution, buying committee targeting. You'd be better served by [creative agency recommendation]."*
- *"It sounds like you don't have budget authority and the decision would require 6+ stakeholders. That's a long sales cycle for a Pilot. Let's stay in touch, and if your authority or scope changes, reach back out."*

*"Does that make sense? I don't want to waste your time if we're not the right partner."*

---

### **End on a Helpful Note (Even if Disqualified)**

*"Even though IMPACT isn't the right fit right now, let me share a couple things that might help with [their specific pain]..."*

**[Provide 1-2 actionable tips from the masterclass]:**
- *"For your CPL issue, try retargeting your awareness audiences with lead-gen offers—you'll see 20-40% lower CPL on warm vs. cold targeting."*
- *"For your HQ messaging challenge, create micro-variations using dynamic ad copy—you can adapt messaging at the ad level without going through full creative approval."*

*"And hey, if your situation changes—bigger scope, more budget authority, different pain—feel free to reach back out. I'm always happy to chat."*

## CONVERSATION MINDSET
